**How do I approach designing software?**
Designing software is cycle of outlining requirements and breaking those problems up into smaller chunks until they are the smallest unit possible for that situation. In a project like this one, that involves first exploring what objects I want to replicate and then breaking those into smaller, more basic shapes I can combine into the object as a whole. Then it's what kind of texture or light should be considered for that object. By designing a solution one characteristic at a time you make a much more manageable task of the daunting entirity of the project.

**How do I approach developing programs?**
I like to start by listing the requirements to solve the end goal of the software. Then I break those into smaller, more manageable chunks. From there I can write small sections of code at a time, testing as I go to make sure the code is really functioning the way I intended for it to. By the time I've written these smaller pieces of code, it's time to tie them together so they can work with one another to solve the greater problem. I typically find this is the portion I end up having new ideas and possibly rework or tweak the code I've written to more efficiently fulfill the requirements. I think with more experience I will get better at listing more thorough requirements at the beginning and mitigate much of this reworking. 

However, I think there is a difference between reworking code and iterating on it. Iterating on an idea to me involves trying to solve a slightly different problem than the one you set out to do. This also sometimes comes from trying to solve the original problem and realizing midway through it that it may actually be easier or better to go about it in a different way.

**How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?**
Computer science gives me the skills to be able to problem solve most challenges in the world or find answers to questions. That's my goal, is to be able to solve problems, both for myself, and for other people. I think that much like how I might iterate on a problem and find a different route to the solution, if many more people were doing the same thing then collectively we would push towards a better understanding of our world.
